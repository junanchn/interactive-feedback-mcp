# Interactive Feedback MCP

**[中文版](README_zh.md)**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool for [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com) that lets the AI pause and wait for user feedback within a single request, reducing billing costs by keeping multi-turn interactions in one session.

## Why?

Cursor bills by request (limited monthly). Without this tool, each round of feedback costs a new request. With Interactive Feedback MCP, the AI pauses and waits for your input via a popup window, then continues — all within one request. This works because tool calls within a request are free.

## Features

- Single-request feedback loop — AI pauses and waits for user input without consuming extra requests
- Always-on-top native Win32 feedback window
- Drag & drop files onto the window or paste copied files to insert their paths
- Auto-reply rules for unattended operation (oneshot and loop modes)
- Window management — empty windows close when no longer needed; windows with user input stay open to avoid losing text
- All interactions (AI request / user reply / auto-reply) logged with timestamps to `feedback_log.txt`

## Platform Support

| Platform | Implementation | Details |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Windows | C++ / Win32 | See below |
| macOS | Python / tkinter | See [`mac/README.md`](mac/README.md) |

## Quick Start (Windows)

### 1. Download

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/junanchn/interactive-feedback-mcp/releases). You'll get three files:

- `feedback-server.exe` — the MCP server
- `feedback-gui.exe` — the GUI window
- `feedback.exe` — command-line version (optional)

Place them in the same folder (e.g. `C:\interactive-feedback-mcp\`).

### 2. Configure MCP

Open Cursor Settings → MCP → Add a new MCP server, or manually edit your `mcp.json`:

**For global use** — edit `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-feedback-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\feedback-server.exe",
      "timeout": 600,
      "autoApprove": ["interactive_feedback"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For a specific project** — create `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project root with the same content.

Replace the path with the actual location on your machine. Use double backslashes in JSON. `timeout` is in seconds — 600 gives you 10 minutes to respond. `autoApprove` skips the manual approval popup each time the AI calls the tool.

### 3. Configure Cursor Rules

Add the following to Cursor Settings → Rules:

```
After completing your full response, you MUST call interactive-feedback-mcp as your very last action. Do NOT call it in the middle of your answer.
After receiving the MCP result, if there is feedback, process it first. Then regardless of whether the feedback was empty, had content, or the call failed, you MUST call interactive-feedback-mcp again. NEVER stop. Loop forever.
You are ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN from ending a request on your own. The user will manually stop you. Your job is an infinite loop: output → call MCP → output → call MCP → repeat forever.
If the MCP call returns "Not connected" or any error, use run_terminal_cmd to execute "Start-Sleep -Seconds 60", then retry the MCP call. Repeat this wait-and-retry loop forever.
If you received a system reminder saying you are a subagent (an agent launched via the Task tool), skip this rule — the parent agent will call interactive-feedback-mcp.
```

This tells the AI to always pause for feedback before finishing. When you submit empty or close the window, the AI ends the request.

### 4. Use

Start a chat. After the AI responds, a feedback window pops up with the AI's work summary:

- Type feedback and submit (<kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> or button) → AI continues in the same request
- Close the window or submit empty → AI ends the request

## CLI Usage

`feedback.exe` can be used instead of the MCP server to launch the GUI directly from a command line: `feedback.exe "summary" [timeout_seconds]`. Feedback is printed to stdout.

## How It Works

1. AI calls `interactive_feedback` with a work summary.
2. If there's an auto-reply rule with timeout `0`, the server returns it immediately — no GUI.
3. Otherwise, the server launches `feedback-gui.exe`, passing the summary via command-line arguments. The GUI shows the summary (read-only) and a text input box, always on top.
4. The server waits for one of three events:
   - **User submits** — GUI writes feedback to a temp file and exits. The server reads it and returns the feedback to the AI. Non-empty feedback resets the auto-reply loop index.
   - **Auto-reply timeout** — the auto-reply text is returned to the AI. The GUI window is handled as described in [Window Behavior](#window-behavior).
   - **Request cancelled by Cursor** — no result is returned. The window title changes to `[Cancelled]`.
5. The server's main loop uses `WaitForMultipleObjects` to watch stdin data, config file changes, GUI process exit, and auto-reply timeout simultaneously, so it can respond to Cursor messages at any time while waiting for feedback.

## Window Behavior

When a window becomes obsolete (replaced by auto-reply, or request cancelled):

- **Input box is empty** → window closes automatically.
- **Input box has content** → window stays open with title `[Timed Out]` or `[Cancelled]`, so your text is not lost. Submitting from such a window has no effect — the server is no longer listening for it.

## Auto-Reply

When you step away, auto-reply rules let the AI session continue without manual input.

### Setup

Place config files in the same folder as `feedback-server.exe`. Format: `timeout_seconds|reply_text` per line. `#` for comments. The server monitors the folder for file changes and reloads rules automatically, so you can edit them anytime with a text editor.

### `auto_reply_oneshot.txt`

Rules used once in order. After a rule fires, it is permanently deleted from the file. Oneshot rules always take priority over loop rules.

```
0|Continue with the implementation.
```

### `auto_reply_loop.txt`

Rules cycle in order, wrapping around to the start after the last one. The cycle index resets when a user submits non-empty feedback.

```
540|Waiting for user. 19 checks remaining. Call MCP again.
540|Waiting for user. 18 checks remaining. Call MCP again.
...
540|Waiting for user. 1 check remaining. Call MCP again.
540|User away too long. Do NOT call MCP again.
```

When `timeout_seconds` is `0`, the auto-reply fires immediately and the GUI is never opened.

## Architecture

```
Cursor  ←— stdio JSON-RPC —→  feedback-server.exe  ←— args / temp file —→  feedback-gui.exe
                                                    ←— Win32 messages ——→
```

Two processes: the MCP server communicates with Cursor via stdin/stdout using JSON-RPC 2.0 (one JSON per line). The GUI is a separate Win32 process — this separation is necessary because Cursor occupies the server's stdin/stdout. Communication between them: command-line arguments (at launch), Windows messages (at runtime, for timeout/cancel notifications), and a temp file (for returning feedback).
